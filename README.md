# Android-Kotlin-Todo-App

This application was for a final project in my Adroid class. 

I created a To-Do app that allows a user to type in items. There is a button next to the item where if selected, it will strike the item through. There is also an option to delete the tasks.

I followed a few different tutorials in order to complete this application, but I wasn't able to stop the app from resetting once it is closed or moved to the background.
